description: Avoiding death is one of the most fundamental human instincts. The
  majority tries to avoid physical injury and fatality by taking active steps.
  However, for those who are not faced with the imminent possibility of death,
  it is not enough merely to be alive. Quality of life has become the new
  alchemy.  The early alchemists sought the elusive philosopherâ€™s stone and were
  part of a long spiritual tradition looking for the secret to eternal life. Our
  present knowledge of the strength and frailties of the human body not only
  helps us to live longer, healthier lives, but also gives us a hyper awareness
  of our mortality. We use all the means at our disposal to prevent damage to
  our bodies and to care for them. This extends to all aspects of our lives,
  from how we live and eat to the products we choose to buy. This awareness is
  more important now than ever before, technology, nowadays, accelerates the
  evolution process. Mankind is mostly looking for inner self-development and
  immortality. They want to achieve this by cultivating their inner and outer
  person. Nature plays a central role as inspirator in this mission as it is the
  beginning and the end of everything and offers the information for evolution.
