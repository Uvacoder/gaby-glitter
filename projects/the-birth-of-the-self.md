title: The Birth of Self
coverImage: /uploads/liquid-lines-sculpture-copy.jpg
description: With the work The Birth of Self, I touch upon philosophical themes
  of selfhood, boundaries of personal space, individual exploration and
  reflection, and societal ‘rebirth’ through individual self-realisation.
  Birthing the Self, after one’s Self is ‘born’ (or extending its presence in
  the I), one does not reach a final state of some sort. It is questionable if
  there even is a final Self. Nevertheless, the environment is expanded,
  providing a new position from which to start the process again—as a new
  process of realisation of Self, with a new (egg) shell to crack. In this new,
  expanded environment, what is Self, and what is Other, will again become the
  dynamic. A following desire is feeding the Will and commencing metamorphosis
  to break the shell and to Birth the Self, and so on, in a continuing flow of
  breaking boundaries, breaking shells, giving Birth to the Self, and future
  Selves.
