title: The Birth of the Self
coverImage: /uploads/liquid-lines-sculpture-copy.jpg
description: "The Self is partly constructed by others when we mirror the Other
  to condition the Self how to behave and how to be. While mirroring others, we
  can get conflicted, when a part of the Self would not resonate with Otherâ€™s
  being. Complying could disconnect us from another source of self-construction,
  an inner source: the autonomous Self. We are confronted with the role that the
  other plays in our existence: where does the conditioned Self end and the
  autonomous Self begin. Is it possible to leave our psychological skin. Can we
  give Birth to the Self."
