description: The Somethingist is constantly researching new ideas and thoughts.
  It is a continuous process where there are no wrong questions. It is searching
  in all layers of written and can transform these thoughts and ideas to its own
  vision. Blank but a place where all existing colors are assembled.Â  The
  textiles show the exploration of different paths, of the different spaces of
  blank and blankend. These are textiles with the underlying thought that the
  textile can and might change by wearing them, depending on the individual who
  is wearing / exploring the textile.
