description: "The Somethingist is constantly researching new ideas and thoughts.
  It is a continuous process with no wrong questions or answers. It is a
  research in all layers of the known and unknown and these thoughts and ideas
  can be transformed to ones own vision. A blank space but a place where all
  existing colors are assembled.  The textiles show the exploration of different
  paths, of the different spaces of blank and blanked. These are textiles with
  the underlying thought that the textile can and might change by wearing them,
  depending on the individual who is wearing/exploring the textile. "
