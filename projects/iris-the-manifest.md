description: "Iris is developed as inspirator for a new philosophy of life. The
  current performance society is falling apart and the systems are failing.
  There is a quest for more than just performing: we are looking for a new
  philosophy. Iris acts as inspirator for this new view of the world and
  propagates this through textile. Textile is an extension of the character and
  is so close to humans that it is worn as a second skin. The textile industry
  is like the rest of society, which also relates to the performance and
  efficiency pressures and currently lacks exactly the personification that
  society needs. Iris connects the need for a new philosophy with the current
  lack of personalization in the textile industry.  Iris is a philosophical
  thought and inspiration on how the society could evolve after the current
  devolution. Itâ€™s a building block for raising awareness and to start a
  discussion. Iris is written as manifest."
